### Planned timeline:
1) Add a skybox.

2) Add home frame with outer walls that cannot be walked through (maybe a cool shader too).
   - [Preventing walking through walls example](https://webvr.donmccurdy.com/walls/)
   - [Lava shader source files](https://github.com/stemkoski/three.js/tree/master/examples/textures/lava)
   - [Shader animations exmaple](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Shader-Animate.html)

3) Add a ground plane with a cool texture
   - [Example 1](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/hello-metaverse/)
   
4) Add 1 main room and a surrounding area outside of the main room

5) Add models to each room
   - For simplicity, use .gltf format models
   - If needed, compress them in MeshLab.
  
6) Add a video texture to a TV model
   - [Example 1](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Video.html)

7) Add a water shader to make up a swimming pool
